Hello there! I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu) advised by [Dr. Tyler Derr](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~derrtyle/). Prior to that, I completed my B.E. degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019. My main research interests focus on Data-centric Graph Machine Learning and Data-quality Aware Graph Neural Networks with applications in Graph-enhanced Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval. I have multiple publications in KDD, WWW, CIKM, WSDM, AAAI. In addition, I regularly serve as PC members and reviewers for multiple international conferences and journals in machine learning and data mining such as KDD, ICML, AAAI, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, TKDD and TNNLS. I plan to graduate around **Summer 2024** and am now considering both **academia and industrial research positions**! In addition, I am also welcoming any potential **summer internship** next year.

Research Interests:
------
- Graph Neural Networks, Graph Machine Learning
- Data-centric AI and Graph Data-quality Issues: Imbalance/Bias/Topology/Weak
- AI for Science/Infrastructure
- Recommender Systems, Information Retrieval

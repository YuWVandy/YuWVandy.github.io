<span style="color:red">**I am currently on the academic job market. Feel free to reach out for any opportunities!**</span>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu) advised by [Dr. Tyler Derr](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~derrtyle/). Prior to that, I completed my B.E. degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019. My main research interests focus on Data-centric Graph Machine Learning and Data-quality Aware Graph Neural Networks with applications in Graph-enhanced Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval. I have multiple publications in KDD, WWW, CIKM, WSDM, and AAAI. In addition, I regularly serve as PC members and reviewers for multiple international conferences and journals in machine learning and data mining, such as KDD, ICML, AAAI, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, TKDD, and TNNLS. In addition, I won the best paper award in the <a href='https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2020/student-team-takes-top-honors-in-data-science-challenge/'>2020 Smokey Mountain Data Challenge Competition by ORNL</a> and <a href='https://glfrontiers.github.io/'>GLFrontiers Workshop at Neurips'23!</a>, first-author of <a href='https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/ece/Graduate/best-paper.php'>Vanderbilt‚Äôs C.F.Chen Best Paper Award in 2022</a>, co-author of <a href='https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/ece/Graduate/best-paper.php'>Vanderbilt's C.F. Chen Best Paper Runner-Up Award in 2023</a>, and selected as the sole graduate student recipient of <a href='https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2023/08/04/five-students-receive-2023-graduate-leadership-anchor-awards/'>Vanderbilt's Graduate Leadership Anchor Award for Research in 2023</a>. Moreover, my work Imbalanced Graph Classification via GoG and Collaboration-aware Graph Convolution has been selected as the top-10 most influential paper in <a href='https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/09/most-influential-cikm-papers-2023-09/'>CIKM'22</a> and <a href='https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/09/most-influential-www-papers-2023-09/'>WWW'23</a>.

Research Interests (<a href='https://yuwvandy.github.io/_pages/2023_RS_YuWang_Oct_20.pdf'>Research Statement)</a>:
------
- Graph Neural Networks, Graph Machine Learning
- Data-centric AI and Graph Data-quality Issues: Topology/Imbalance/Bias/Weak
- AI for Science/Infrastructures
- Recommender Systems, Information Retrieval, Infrastructure Networks
